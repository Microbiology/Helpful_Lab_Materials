# PandocAcademicCoverLetter
Easily write letters in your academic or other professional life.

# Usage
Create your letter by following the template provided by the example letter `coverletter.md`. You can change your signature and institute logo by changing the `Signature.pdf` and `Michigan.pdf` files, respectively. Once you have your markdown letter the way you like it, go ahead and run the shell script as:

```bash
bash ./renderletter
```

See the final (example) product [here](https://github.com/Microbiology/Helpful_Lab_Materials/blob/master/WritingCoverLetter/coverletter.pdf).

# Dependencies
This tool is pretty light on dependencies. All you need is to have Pandoc running on your computer. Don't yet have Pandoc? Follow the installation instructions [here](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).
